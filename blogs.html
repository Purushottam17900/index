	<p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; font-size: 120%; text-align: justify;">
	Today, Israel is a high-tech superpower and one of the world’s top weapons exporters with approximately $6.5 billion in annual arms sales. Since 1985, Israel is the world’s largest exporter of drones, responsible for about 60 percent of the global market, trailed by the US, whose market share is under 25 percent.  But the story had been very different all the years back to its formation as a country. At that time Israel did not have natural resources to fund its economy, as its Arabian neighbors had in the form of oil. It is indeed very much intriguing, that a country which was nonexistent 70 years earlier, and now has a population of just 8 million is a superpower and has one of the most technologically advanced military in the world. 
Israel had been in the perpetual state of conflict since its foundation. They have had a full-blown war in nearly every decade. This constant struggle has forced the Israelis to be creative and come up with innovative ways and weapons to survive. The answer to the above question can also be the compulsory military service that they have to undergo at the age of the 18, which has missions including those in which the youth have to go beyond the enemy lines and may have deadly consequences. It may seem somewhat frightening to us that people of our age do this while we sit comfortably in our homes with our regular routines.
<br> The Israel that we see as a country today had been just an idea once. By the end of the Nineteenth century, Jewish people were being attacked all over the Europe. It has been clear that they had to find a new home. A Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl introduced Zionism, which was the re-establishment of a Jewish nation that will be called Israel. At that time, the area that includes modern day Israel was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. With the increase in violence with Jews in Europe, they started immigrating to that part of the world that was the only safe place for them. They started buying lands in the Palestine region. The number of immigrants increased, which was not welcomed by the Arab population of the Palestine region. As a result, the Arabs started attacking the Jewish settlements and vandalizing their property. By 1914, the Jewish population in the Palestine region had increased to 60,000. The Ottoman rule ended in the First World War. The British came up with the Balfour Declaration which was meant to favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, but that nothing should be done to prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The British proposed that they will rule there in the name of ‘British Mandate in Palestine’, until Palestinians became capable of ruling themselves. They started separate institutes for the Muslims, Jews and the Christians to train them. This only started violence and riots with one community pitched against the other. In 1920s, British tried to inhabitate the Jews at that place.  By 1938, 30% population of the region was Jewish. Arabs saw this as a threat to themselves, and they revolted against the British. The revolt was suppressed with the help of Jews militants. The Palestinians were promised that they will be made independent in the next 10 years.
