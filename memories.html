		I had a very good time during the 5 years in my boarding school. Most memorable one was the Kolkata trip with the whole class for 4 days. We visited many places for sightseeing such as Victoria Memorial, Museum, Zoo, Water park, Eden Gardens and many more. In school campus, many cultural activities, specially those in the last year were very much fun.
