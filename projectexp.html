	The first project project that i remember to have done was in class 7 in the Biennial Exhibition of my school. I was in the Little Humanist department of the Exhibition, where I did a project on various scams that had taken place at that time in the recent past. I remember the next project that i did was in class 9 in the Exhibition again, but this time in the History department where I made replicas of a few architectural wonders of the world such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. After that I did some other projects in science and computer subjects under the school curriculum.<br>Recently, I had a project on the hardware components of the computer. It was to be done in the form of a word document. I learned many new things on this topic, specially the working of the hardware components.
